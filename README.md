# The effect of balancing methods on model behavior in natural language processing imbalance classification problems
The objective of this study is to assess and analyze the performance of models trained on varied dataset configurations, encompassing diverse class balances and employing various techniques for automatic balancing methods. Furthermore, we aim to investigate how these factors impact the explainability and interpretability of the models.
