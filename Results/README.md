## Results
#### This directory contains notebooks used for results analysis and creating visualisations:
* Performance_measure_analysis.ipynb- notebook used to evaluate discriminatory power and calibration of trained models
* XAI_analysis.ipynb- notebook used to evaluate the results of XAI analysis
#### It also contains saved performance metirc values:
* nlpaug_SVM.csv- table with metrics of SVM models
* nlpaug_lstm.csv- table with metrics of LSTM models
* nlpaug_distilbert.csv- table with metrics of DistilBERT models
#### Results of XAI analysis were too big to save on github thus are included in separate drive:
