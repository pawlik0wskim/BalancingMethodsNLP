      "['works, useful, but. .. I have bought it for substituting my laptop when I am lazy to open that or when I am traveling and I need no a real computer. I have also though to use it as ebookreader for special cases (primarily PDF magazines, or handbooks ). Now, I am still in the discovery state. But, it is difficult to tell some new issues about a one year model This is a refurbished, 32 GB model, and this is better than expected because of the write only external SDcard. I also bought some accessories: USB network adapter (Plugable USB 2. 0 to 10 / 100 Fast Ethernet LAN Network RJ45 Adapter (ASIX AX88772 chipset) ), Moko holder, some cheap pens, and a screen protector. The tablet works as expected, but it has some serious weaknesses. The battery life should be longer, now 4 - 5 hrs seemes to be not thw maximum. Difficult to find the switch on in dark. The USB slots and power slot could be better on the site and not the bottom (portrait mode ). As an ebookreader it is not a good choice. I usually go to sleep in 15 mins of reading due to dthe lcd screen. Multimedia works nicely, even the quality of speakers is acceptable. The touchscreen works well with fingers. With pens there are challenges, but that might be rather a sw issue than the tablet, Becaue some programs uses it smoothly, some others not. The G sensor works nicely, which is particularly important when USB network connection is used. The camera function is a joke. If you want to use the full resolution you have to pay for it! And, it is strange that message is hidden now (because of no other option, I would pay for it ). GPS works nicely, although the voice direction could be better. Some linux options (like console, ssh, etc. , at least on a non rooted machine) are not really working, but I do not know this is how much tablet specific and how much android. The registering of tablet icon is useless. It is a one time activiy, but link (icon) removal is not obvious. The four screens seem to me not enough and perhaps user created extra pages would be useful to avoid the very crowded ckreens. There is no free office suite (I know that it is not this tablet related ). This is a real problem, because sometimes it would ba nice to correct something (presentation or doc ). The nonfree programs do not worth the price at all (none of them! , based on the trial versions ). I have tried the bloated one also (read only mode is free) but that is worse than a bad joke, I surely will not buy it. Free apps for taking notes (as pictures) are nice and easy to write by hands. The virtual keyboard is less convenient. It is difficult fond a good PDF reader too. It is necessary to mention some Toshiba related issues. Fortunately, I have not needed to contact with the customer support, so it increases positive points. But, there are issues what are reducing the satisfaction. It is full with bloatwares. Without rooting they cannot be removed. The SD card is mounted as read only. And still Honeycomb and not ICS! These are very disturbing. I cannot believe that at Toshiba only so bad sw developers are working, who have not been able to port ICS for almost a year. And now it is still a promise only. Buth, it might happen that that some stupid managers are in the background, and for them the selling is more important than the users satisfaction. The Toshiba market is strange and probably useless. I could not deduce its purpose. The only free program what I downloaded as test, does not run. Because of the irresponsiveness of Toshiba for software versions I do not expect more from the nonfree programs, too. Accessories: The USB network adapter is nice, although there are places to improve it. It is recommended for everybody for the case of non wifi network. Moko holder is worse than expected and described by users. It seems to me that is a little undersized by 1 - 2 mm. Without alternatives, it is recommmended to buy the cheapest one. I did not expect too much from the pens (not Toshiba, <2 USD ), but those are at least completely filled. Some sws are well working with them, some others not completely, but as a pointing device it is [[ok, writing fingers seems to be better. Although, I ordered and received a screen protector too, I have not mounted it. First I want to get experiences as is. Finally, the screen is from glass, and normal use cannot cause damages. Briefly, I am very happy to have this tablet, and I do hope the problems mentioned by others will not appear. The four stars is due to mentioned bloatwares and not up to date OS.'\n",

My wife also owns a lepan tc 970 that i bought her for xmas that is quite nice for the price so I know what to look for. This novo 7 elf is pretty astounding for $140. The unit I received already had ics 4.0.3(the version of android that this elf shipped with works perfectly as intended, it is not glitchy or \"beta build\" in any way, shape or form.) as well as google play and adobe flash 11 pre installed. I was pleasantly surprised to find this out as i half expected to have to boot a custom rom to get google play. The gig of ram makes games and video this units specialty. I love how this rom lets you tap the left or right side of the home screen to switch pages. You can absolutely tell that this tab was designed for gaming, the user interface feels like a gaming tablet. I got it for my sons 5th birthday thats coming up(he is constantly using my wifes and is already quite good with a tab). The screen is the same resolution as a kindle fire and looks quite good. Perfect blend of price and performance for anyone. for a 4yr old turning 5 it is straight pimpin. I have a feeling his psp may be getting handed down to his little brother shortly.

      "['wow. . plays \" modern combat 3 \" flawlessly. Not only does it play mc3 flawlessly, it also plays it in 1080p to your tv or projector through hdmi. I have heavily used ipad 1 and 2s, kindle fire, hp touchpad with ics, pandigital supernova and many others. My wife also owns a lepan tc 970 that i bought her for dec 25 that is quite nice for the price so I know what to look for. This novo seven elf is pretty astounding for $ 140. The unit I received already had ics 4. 0. 3 (the version of android that this elf shipped with works perfectly as intended, it is not glitchy or \" beta build \" in any way, shape or form.) as well as google play and adobe flash 11 pre installed. I was pleasantly surprised to find this out as i half expected to have to boot a custom rom to get google play. The gig of ram makes games and video this units specialty. I love how this rom lets you tap the left or right side of the home screen to switch pages. You can absolutely tell that this tab be designed for gaming, the user interface feels like a gaming tablet. I got it for my sons 5th birthday thats coming up (he is constantly using my wifes and is already quite good with a tab ). The screen is the same resolution as a kindle fire and looks quite good. Perfect blend of price and performance for anyone. for a 4yr old turning 5 it is straight pimpin. I have a feel his psp may be getting handed down to his little brother shortly. If you can find it for this price, don \\' t hesitate.'\n",
