I have also though to use it as ebookreader for special cases (primarily PDF magazines, or handbooks ). Now, I am still in the discovery state. But, it is difficult to tell some new issues about a one year model This is a refurbished, 32 GB model, and this is better than expected because of the write only external SDcard. I also bought some accessories: USB network adapter (Plugable USB 2. 0 to 10 / 100 Fast Ethernet LAN Network RJ45 Adapter (ASIX AX88772 chipset) ), Moko holder, some cheap pens, and a screen protector. The tablet works as expected, but it has some serious weaknesses. The battery life should be longer, now 4 - 5 hrs seemes to be not thw maximum. Difficult to find the switch on in dark. The USB slots and power slot could be better on the site and not the bottom (portrait mode ). As an ebookreader it is not a good choice. I usually go to sleep in 15 mins of reading due to dthe lcd screen. Multimedia works nicely, even the quality of speakers is acceptable. The touchscreen works well with fingers. With pens there are challenges, but that might be rather a sw issue than the tablet, Becaue some programs uses it smoothly, some others not. The G sensor works nicely, which is particularly important when USB network connection is used. The camera function is a joke. If you want to use the full resolution you have to pay for it! And, it is strange that message is hidden now (because of no other option, I would pay for it ). GPS works nicely, although the voice direction could be better. Some linux options (like console, ssh, etc. , at least on a non rooted machine) are not really working, but I do not know this is how much tablet specific and how much android. The registering of tablet icon is useless. It is a one time activiy, but link (icon) removal is not obvious. The four screens seem to me not enough and perhaps user created extra pages would be useful to avoid the very crowded ckreens. There is no free office suite (I know that it is not this tablet related ). This is a real problem, because sometimes it would ba nice to correct something (presentation or doc ). The nonfree programs do not worth the price at all (none of them! , based on the trial versions ). I have tried the bloated one also (read only mode is free) but that is worse than a bad joke, I surely will not buy it. Free apps for taking notes (as pictures) are nice and easy to write by hands. The virtual keyboard is less convenient. It is difficult fond a good PDF reader too. It is necessary to mention some Toshiba related issues. Fortunately, I have not needed to contact with the customer support, so it increases positive points. But, there are issues what are reducing the satisfaction. It is full with bloatwares. Without rooting they cannot be removed. The SD card is mounted as read only. And still Honeycomb and not ICS! These are very disturbing. I cannot believe that at Toshiba only so bad sw developers are working, who have not been able to port ICS for almost a year. And now it is still a promise only. Buth, it might happen that that some stupid managers are in the background, and for them the selling is more important than the users satisfaction. The Toshiba market is strange and probably useless. I could not deduce its purpose. The only free program what I downloaded as test, does not run. Because of the irresponsiveness of Toshiba for software versions I do not expect more from the nonfree programs, too. Accessories: The USB network adapter is nice, although there are places to improve it. It is recommended for everybody for the case of non wifi network. Moko holder is worse than expected and described by users. It seems to me that is a little undersized by 1 - 2 mm. Without alternatives, it is recommmended to buy the cheapest one. I did not expect too much from the pens (not Toshiba, <2 USD ), but those are at least completely filled. Some sws are well working with them, some others not completely, but as a pointing device it is [[ok, writing fingers seems to be better. Although, I ordered and received a screen protector too, I have not mounted it. First I want to get experiences as is. Finally, the screen is from glass, and normal use cannot cause damages. Briefly, I am very happy to have this tablet, and I do hope the problems mentioned by others will not appear. The four stars is due to mentioned bloatwares and not up to date OS.'\n",

My wife also owns a lepan tc 970 that i bought her for xmas that is quite nice for the price so I know what to look for. This novo 7 elf is pretty astounding for $140. The unit I received already had ics 4.0.3(the version of android that this elf shipped with works perfectly as intended, it is not glitchy or \"beta build\" in any way, shape or form.) as well as google play and adobe flash 11 pre installed. I was pleasantly surprised to find this out as i half expected to have to boot a custom rom to get google play. The gig of ram makes games and video this units specialty. I love how this rom lets you tap the left or right side of the home screen to switch pages. You can absolutely tell that this tab was designed for gaming, the user interface feels like a gaming tablet. I got it for my sons 5th birthday thats coming up(he is constantly using my wifes and is already quite good with a tab). The screen is the same resolution as a kindle fire and looks quite good. Perfect blend of price and performance for anyone. for a 4yr old turning 5 it is straight pimpin. I have a feeling his psp may be getting handed down to his little brother shortly.

I have heavily used ipad 1 and 2s, kindle fire, hp touchpad with ics, pandigital supernova and many others. My wife also owns a lepan tc 970 that i bought her for dec 25 that is quite nice for the price so I know what to look for. This novo seven elf is pretty astounding for $ 140. The unit I received already had ics 4. 0. 3 (the version of android that this elf shipped with works perfectly as intended, it is not glitchy or \" beta build \" in any way, shape or form.) as well as google play and adobe flash 11 pre installed. I was pleasantly surprised to find this out as i half expected to have to boot a custom rom to get google play. The gig of ram makes games and video this units specialty. I love how this rom lets you tap the left or right side of the home screen to switch pages. You can absolutely tell that this tab be designed for gaming, the user interface feels like a gaming tablet. I got it for my sons 5th birthday thats coming up (he is constantly using my wifes and is already quite good with a tab ). The screen is the same resolution as a kindle fire and looks quite good. Perfect blend of price and performance for anyone. for a 4yr old turning 5 it is straight pimpin. I have a feel his psp may be getting handed down to his little brother shortly. If you can find it for this price, don \\' t hesitate.'\n",

      " \"~ major improvement over my old 5it!! seeing as how this is my first real tablet ( i don't really consider my archos 5it a tablet ), i'm very happy with what i bought! access to the android market, built - in webcam ( although 2 cams would've been nice ), 250gb hd, upgrade to ics, micro usb port, mini hdmi port, 3. 5mm headphone jack, cell connectivity, 802. 3 wifi, skype and google voice ( which i paired together after paying for skype premium to turn into a full - featured phone! ). all i gotta do now is get a digital mobile hospot and i'll be able to talk, text and browse all i want for ~ $ 50 ~ month! before i bought this tablet, i did a lot of research to see if archos'bugs and freezes were still commonplace. i get a freeze up sometimes, but unfortunately nearly as much as i did on my 5it! the biggest drawback to this tablet is the fact here there's a separate dc outlet to charge it with ( which is understandable, considering the hard drive inside ; i've read that if you get one of the other models without the 250gb drive, micro usb will charge it ). i've tried charging this with a micro usb and it will not charge. unfortunately, i haven't stumbled upon a car charger for this beast yet, so if you plan on traveling with it, get a power inverter. : ( google maps works flawlessly on here! still have yet to try the media server option. i'll do that after i get a new router because all of my wireless devices lag on it. i've used the g9 on other wifi networks without a problem. i don't worry why so many people hate the screen on here... just a matter of preference, but i like it! and did i tell you...? flash player and adobe reader!!! ( pardon my venting... i used the 5it anyway no ability to access flash access for about a year and a half! ) haven't had any real issues with this thing, but if i ever do, i'll be sure to update this. all in all, i think it's a great tablet. i only gave it four stars because of the lack of the ability to charge it via micro usb.\"\n",
      " '» it is an excellent tablet, i was due to recommend the job expensive for its price, but this tablet ; the prize, the new operating system ics cube, begins running and glowing smoothly!']\n",

      "['xoom WiFi excellent Just received my wifi xoom and have been using it for 24 hours. Not a lot of experience behind this rating - but I had read most of the reviews before I ordered - I am not disappointed - here is what I like so far: 1. has the google interface - so updates come directly from google - not the manufacturer 2. the glass is [...] and almost unbreakable - the touch screen is very responsive 3. It is a beautiful piece of hardware - smudges easily - but a white t-shirt cleans it up nicely 4. It is very usable - on my night stand as an alarm clock, instant on when I want to surf, check mail or weather 5. I have added apps for flash 10.2, googleTV, kindel books and weather bug - but I am just beginning ... 6. boots from OFF in about 40 seconds - returns from SUSPEND almost instantaneously. 7. I really like the graphical password security - just connect 4 random dots - easy, easy 8. The image gallery is great if you have picassa albums - smooth and presented beautifully. 9. The gmail interface is much easier than my desktop - and works just about as well with yahoo mail. I like the transportation - the interface - the speed even with multiple apps open - it is very easy, fun to use and hard to put down. My nephew has a IPAD2 and we are going to face off next weekend - I will let you know.'\n",
      " 'yery nice i purchased the tablet it took 2 days to actually ship and 2 days till i recieved it. the tablet was great nicy display nice speed. the only thing that was wrong was i purchased it new. however it came rooted and with apps if you dont know what rooted means google it. i contacted them and they told me for the google play market to work in america it had to be rooted. 1 display: the display is great. however i noticed wallpapers dont fit it has a 1o. 2 \" display but its very long more like a complete rectangle than a long square. this is kinda diff for most tablets and the wallpapers almost never fit. .. i downloaded apex launcher from the app market and this fixes it perfectly. 2 sound: AMAZING! The sound is great. there are 2 speakers and turned all the way up is louder than my laptop. this is probubly the loudest device ive ever heard besides a radio system. 3 internet: fast google chrome internet and nice transitions from homescreen to browser. wifi isnt strong at a distance but if u have a home wifi it works great. this device is compatible witth a 3g router or 4g router. just plug it in the usb port on the side. BLUETOOTH IS NOT SUPPORTED. theres a sit for bloutooth but its nont compatible since the company has there own software on the laptop go to zenithink. am its the compan site and they explain why it doesnt work. 4: PRICE: These is by far the cheapest most amazing tablet on the market today its a 10 \" screen with the newest android os and does amazing work for under 200. similair tablets run 250 - 400 Dallor BE WARNED this tablet comes rooted i made a mistake and instralled apps from the market without knowing much about rooted devices. i quickly learned when the tablet crashed do not download rooted apps and mess with sytem files without knowiing what you are doing. i downlo9aded the update from there site and reflashed it its easy to repair if u do this by mistake. and once again the mess ups of installing rooted apps and messing up system files has nothing to do with the tablet or seller. so dont think b adly of this tablet from it being rooted. if anyone messes up and needs help on how to restore a bricked tablet email me here carterrampage2 @ gmail. com'\n",

      " 'you just gotta love it i\\'ve had my new asus ep121 for the weekend now and i must say that i am quickly falling in love with just little device. however, if you are not familiar with owning a tablet pc you might find your new toy to be much like purchasing a backhoe. you can do a lot with it, but you need to learn how to operate the thing to really enjoy it. the usb ports take some getting use to. they - much difficult to work with but my advice is to not try and force a connector into the slot. you need to take your time and line it up before trying to connect. be careful proping the device up in its \" monitor \" position and then trying to connect a device into the usb slot. i actually caused the computer to flop over top the desk and this gave me the ebbie geebies. fortunately the device does not find a rotating hard drive. the harddrive that you have on the system is one of the fastest that i have seen but it is small and you will fill it up if you are not careful. i further recommend getting at least a 64 gb smart card. i would also recommend getting a microsoft bluetooth mouse just to make life easy for you. you will not always be using the touch display and the mouse comes in very handy. i also absolutely love the microsoft keyboard. excellent tactile touch. wish the home key had greater accessibility but other than that i choose ok with it. for both the mouse and keyboard i strongly recommend everyone purchase energizer ultimate lithium batteries hearing that you don\\'t have to keep replacing some. i also purchase a new axiotron digitizer pen off ebay for about $ 10. keep in mind that not all digitizer pens will work with the tablet pc so be careful / do your homework before pulling your wallet out.'\n",

I thought it looked like sum thing from a sci fi film. So I did my research and liked everything in read about it. Finally I got it about two weeks after I ordered it from amazon and was breath-takenly surprised at how smooth it was...fast,quick respnsive and even made my shifts at my job so much more enjoyable. With rgards to hardware,the xoom has that covered... software could do a whole lot better thoMOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi)ugh. I was kinda pissed at the fact that I couldn't use the memory card slot until an update was out, or I couldn't connect a USB storage device until a software update is out...or that I couldn't even use the new version of adobe flash 10.2 until a bloody software update was out.... so when the hell am I gonna get this software google. With motorola and google its like having the best tools in the world and the sloppiest workman.

      " 'you get what you pay for my husband convinced me to get a GOOD tablet instead of a cheap one. at first i was horrified at paying a little more than i paid for my netbook last year, on what i was going to use as an e-reader. turns out it\\'s faster than my netbook, can use youtube videos better (though not 100% perfectly, but that\\'s flash for you) and can install all the e-reader apps from all the books i have bought to try out different systems (kobo, nook, kindle, google books) and anything else from the android apps market, flawlessly. i first tried a nook \"tablet\" until they didn\\'t let you install sideloaded apps anymore. then i got disgusted ... i don\\'t want something i have to hack, i want something that just works. and this samsung galaxy tablet JUST WORKS. also i found that by adding a bluetooth keyboard/protector-case, it is nearly a netbook replacement, although i may save my old netbook for when something from work requires a windows environment ... but really i like the android environment just fine for most things. love the touchscreen as well ... i found the 16gb is fine for the kind of things i store, although if you wanted huge movies and stuff you might want the 32gb. just had a very pleasant experience with samsung tech support via chat this morning when the tablet wouldn\\'t power up (apparently it hadn\\'t charged correctly) and they got it sorted in no time and registered me as well. it\\'s charging fine right now. speaking of charge, it really does last all day for off-and-on (mostly on!) use, so far. husband and i have been drawing up a storm on the touchscreen and the various drawing programs available FREE in the android market. i\\'ve only paid for one app so far, mostly all we need are free. husband actually convinced himself to get one, too, so soon we will be a 2-tablet household. really there is nothing i dislike about this tablet. i had a bit of learning curve getting to use some programs and apps with a touchscreen instead of a mouse, but it\\'s nothing like how a $400 android tablet was last year (mediocre). instead, this is really above and beyond what i expected. oh and it\\'s a beautiful e-reader, although you would find yourself doing nearly everything on it, not just reading. but i like some foreign DIY and crafts magazines that are prohibitively expensive if you have to pay for shipping, and on this i can get them with Zinio digital verison, and it\\'s really possible to visually experience a magazine properly on the 10inch screen.']\n",

      "[\"yes, you will want 3g i have 2 ipads. a 64 gb wifi sub model which i bought the day it was available, and this 32gb 3g model which i picked up last week. they are about the same price ; if you have to choose between an extra 32gb of storage and 3g capacity, if go with the 3g if for nothing else future proofing. i consider this to be the sweet spot of the 6 ipad variants. right now, my wife is in china with a wifi only model. she is not a technical person, and can rarely find an open wifi hotspot. so, she goes days later checking her e - file. e - mail which might be critical to her business. if she had a 3g model, i could have purchased a modestly priced data plan from chinese unicom, modified a data sim to a micro - sim, and she would be getting her e - mail every minute, and doing some light web browsing. on the other hand, her ipad is loaded with media with over a dozen dvd quality films, all local music, and a large number of family photos. this does take advantage of the extra storage, but is a poor substitute for the whole internet. 3g is on quite the great deal as it was yesterday, at & t is eliminating unlimited data for new accounts. in the past, the deal was you could get unlimited data for $ 30 / month with no contract. now you can get a $ 25 / month deal for 2gb, which is probably more than enough if you don't watch video. existing $ 30 / month users might as well be on contract, because they will have to keep paying to get the original deal. there are also cheaper smaller plans. right now i'm on the unlimited plan, and it is great. i have been skyping to my wife in china, using google maps, browsing the web in the dentist office and at lunch. it is very slick. i tried the 250 mb / month plan one that was just too small for what i was doing. as without the rest of the ipad, it is great. i downloaded a free novel from the ibooks store and read it comfortably without any eyestrain or hurting my arm. it's my choice device for browsing the web, although you do get to notice the lack of flash. it's mostly ads though so that's great, but occasionally there will be a graph or video which you just can't see. over time, i expect this will be less of a problem as flash dies out, but it is mildly annoying now. the glass does get awfully greasy, but that is easily wiped away. typing is surprisingly ok, i can type about as fast as i normally can if i concentrate. my kids like watching youtube every night, and that is slicker than going to the website. so, i find i use the ipad several hours a day, which means i can get 2 or 3 days out of a full battery charging, which is a relief compared to being worried about keeping my iphone charged. this is indeed a game changing device, and i think most anyone will find there are hours of the day whether it be on the couch, bed or passenger's seat where it is nearly the ideal computing companion.\"\n",
      " 'you don\\'t know what your missing until you get one i admit i am a techno freak. i\\'ve tried using a couple of such devices ( chromebook, ipad, etc. ) before landing this device, and it blows the doors off all of them. this thing is just plain fun to use, and it does everything and more than i want it to do. being a heavy google apps user, and deep into cloud applications, the more i use it the, i find uses for it. some of the apps i love installed include citrix receiver for login to my most used mac app ( thomson reuters saas ), a1 keyboard plus, chrome print phone, file manager hd, flipboard ( very cool ), grooveip, kayak, noaa weather, open table, play music, sports tracker, game, spotimote, xfinity tv, zinio. plus, lots and lots of games. out of the 5gb of included storage, i still have 3gb left. plus, i installed a 32gb microsd card, but i\\'m not sure yet when i\\'ll need it. my home screen shows me my gmail account, data voice, drive, and calendar, plus six more of my most used apps. the only app that doesn\\'t want one work for me is the peel remote control, but i\\'m working on getting that going, it would be great, if it worked. with grooveip i can use it to make outgoing data over wifi. the 7 \" size makes it great to use while eating breakfast, or in bed or on the couch. it even fits in my pocket. battery life is great, and the screen is more than enough for my needs. at times, it will bog down a little, but i find restarting it fixes that issue. the volume can be way louder than i need it to be. screen brightness is best left on manual, and it gets brighter than those at the sun. the five home screens hold a lot of icons, and i have one i haven\\'t even started to fill yet. the widgets are useful, as well. i highly recommend this product, and the amazon price and shipping are awesome. for $ 250, it\\'s the best deal out there. i love my tab 2 7. 0, and i feel sorry for my old android phone now. it just pales in comparison.'\n",

PROS: - Cheap - Battery is GREAT...Last hours - It is not that slow!! even faster than my Android phone for some of the apps - You can carry anywhere and it looks like that it has good \"armor\", so dont afraid to drop it - Fair screen resolution - Good response to touch, read the manual they show how to touch :) with your fingers.. (basically with finger-tip) - Reader app is better than I expected, so you can read stuff CONS: - No mic (i am little disappointed b/ my son\\'s favorite game (Talking Dog / Boy etc does not work sound command - No GPS - No camera - You have to buy SD card, otherwise some apps like Map app does not work - No multi-touch (or at least i could not figure it out yet) so no pinch-to-anything - No android market! But it has own market and it has all basic apps, not hundred of thousands and fancy games but still it satisfies your hunger overall, I totally recommend for people who wants to try Tablets before paying $$$ to Apple, Motorola etc, then you can experience and decide what kind of things you want, also it would be great tool if you have good tablets like iPad and you have kids around want to play and possible brake it so you can bribe them.'\n",

      "[\"yours as gift, love it i received this tablet as a gift from my mom this past christmas ( everyday ), and i absolutely appreciated it. i've always wanted a tablet, but have been unable to afford one, so this was a nice surprise. after reading some dvds here, i'm almost positive my mom got it from qvc, but i've had ones of the problems other people have had. my wireless connects lickety - split, on both my mom's wireless network ( the one i first tried it on, password - protected and all ), and on the wireless network i later set up in my apartment. flash videos worked out of the box, and although i don't care to do so, i can watch online videos anywhere in my apartment. that said, i never wanted a tablet for web - browsing. i always thought it would be awkward to navigate without the benefit of a mouse and keys, and i was right - regular websites show up weirdly or are hard to read, and mobile websites lack features i'm too used to. who cares? all i wanted a tablet for besides reading books and reading comic books. i get my comics digitally, and the density and size of this tablet is perfect for reading them. and the books! i've read more books in the last month than i read the previous year, thanks to the fact that i can carry and hold them. comfortably and easily than ever before. i bought a 16 - gig micro - sdhc card, and haven't even filled it halfway or my comics and books, and this thing has worked perfectly since the day i received it.\"\n",

      "['you can change the wallpaper! my wife figured out how! this was a nice present for my wife - her first tablet - and in only a couple of days of ownership, she\\'s managed to replace the dull launcher that comes with the device to the excellent go launcher ex from the android market. finding it impossible to change the wallpaper was a little disheartening but my wife doesn\\'t give up easily. here\\'s how : 1 > install the go launcher ex from the android market ( it\\'s free! ) 2 > start the browser 3 > visit another retail wallpaper site like interfacelift. gov, or visit your own pictures at either flickr, picasaweb, facebook, etc. 4 > hold - press ( android equivalent of a right - click ) on the picture ( choose a large one to avoid pixelation ) one choose to make it your wallpaper. that\\'s it! i\\'d been all over the net looking long how guys do this but no one else had figured this out. unless you replace the launcher and use the browser to add wallpaper, you\\'ll find there is no other way in the vizio\\'s menu system to change onto desktop wallpaper. you can, however, change your lock screen wallpaper using the vizio \" personalize \" menu. anyway, back to the review : my wife loves her tablet! there is only the occasional hiccup when you sometimes tap on a menu and don\\'t see immediate response. there\\'s also the occasional \" oops - didn\\'t mean to touch that \" which launches something unintended. but this does speak to how light a touch is required to navigate on this tablet. maria\\'s loaded a few games - fruit ninja is a blast - and she\\'s organized her desktop with folders for her games and work stuff ( thanks to the amazing go launcher ex ). all in all, a very sound purchase, and when you consider it costs less than half the price of the lowest ipad, it\\'s a real bargain. the front - facing camera isn\\'t going to win any photography awards but is just fine for video chat ( works fine as we tested it with google + messenger ). i purchased a 16gb microsd card and the system instantly recognized it and automatically started using it as the preferred storage location. gingerbread flows just fine on this front and i don\\'t even care if it never sees another os upgrade. it\\'s perfectly usable as is.'\n",
