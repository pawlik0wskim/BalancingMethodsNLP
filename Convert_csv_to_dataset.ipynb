      "[\"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) directed by robert altman some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel .the novel was a summer smash , topping best - seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads .the only problem : the novel was n't very good .it was far more pulp than pulitzer .but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller .so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen .the director ?francis ford coppola .the book , of course , was mario puzo 's the godfather .the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history .by bringing up the godfather , i do n't mean to suggest that robert altman 's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness .but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material .can you get any more questionable than john grisham ?depends on whom you ask .but there 's no question that grisham 's work grabs people .like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who ca n't tell a well - constructed story from a can of spam .so something in grisham 's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america 's greatest living filmmakers .the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon .> from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe .this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch .witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear .we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone .right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises .pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman .this is what a great director can do for questionable source material .the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases .magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office .outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen .driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home .there he learns more about mallory 's life than he bargained for .her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski - style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter .magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory 's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed- right after he sleeps with her , of course .this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end .he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well .but then dixon 's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger .the cops wo n't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney .his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private - eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) .if this predicament was n't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos .altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh 's performance holds the gingerbread man together .an accomplished actor when he is n't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives .is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ?magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it 's too late .as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are .and life is never so bad that it ca n't get worse . if you 're familiar with altman 's work , you 'll recognize several of his signature techniques .characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent .crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action .dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style .and of course there 'smy favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot .thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i 've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand .and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether .the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film .is it old - school sexism , or a clever in - joke ?you be the judge .but back to the picture at hand .in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we 've all endured .in the hands of a masterlike altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese 's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result .what may prevent it from enduring with altman 's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham 's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up .but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through .that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are .they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill .and that , my friends , should make you very afraid .\"\n",
      " \"you 've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing .the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor 's nell in the haunting , we do n't care .the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike .the seasons have changed since an ex - patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom .desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ), malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) .the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm 's would - be killer :scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret .only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine - tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time .malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole 's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures .he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process .the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist .( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self - rearranging kitchen business from the latter . )it 's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks .cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they 're not out to harm him , really - they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler .perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we 're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight - year - old .that 's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar .we appreciate malcolm 's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed .both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest .willis convinces us that he 's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night .osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do .the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs ' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama - its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading .only because i was expecting something differentdid i notice - rather , feel - the movie 's running time , which is just shy of two hours .the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait .i 'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .\"\n",

      " \"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it .probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it 's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it does n't feature slick one - liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80 's . however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made .corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life .one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him .her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion .maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another .they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover .lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it 's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend .this is not clear to lucas , however .he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what 's about to happen .we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally .they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie .surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school .the next scene is brilliant .maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally .she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened .he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion .in lesser movies this would 've turned into a confrontation between the two characters .but maggie is written smarter than that .she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him .next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) .he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend .what 's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks .of course anyone with a brain can tell what 's gon na happen next .cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas ' relationship .this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone .she 's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer / dryer so he can clean his shirt .maggie is charmed by cappie 's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body .this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires .desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room .it 's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) .lucas finally figures out what 's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance .this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team .the last third of the film revolves around this attempt .while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not .there are many surprisesduring the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up .dave grusin 's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps .lucas is filled with great performances .forget everything you know about corey haim .back in 1986he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain .kerri green is very appealingas maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her .sheen 's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas .there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti 's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks .also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar .when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and johnhughes that .lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so - called classics .but hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it 's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald .it deserves more than that , but i do n't want to be greedy .\"\n",
      " 'zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we do n\\'t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film .zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he \\'d like to think so ) .however , he \\'s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are .zero \\'s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a \" normal \" guy who does the business side of the job -- he \\'s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero \\'s greatness as an investigator .the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero \\'s talents to soon - to - be client gregory stark ( ryan o\\'neal ) .it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about .zero takes the case , and the plot thickens .his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) .despite her luminous and seemingly - harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark .through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him .i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film .i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown \\'s greatness ) .zero effect , which is jake kasdan \\'s first effort as writer / director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts :it \\'san original , funny , and completely involving motion picture .with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them .but he did n\\'t just successfully avoid flaws: he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment .take , for starters ,the great cast of characters .pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really have n\\'t seen from him since spaceballs .zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he \\'s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe .pullman \\'s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice - over as he \\'s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious.ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he \\'s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny .\"i \\'ll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point .\"i have a gun , and everything .\" his character is also well - drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job .o\\'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs .i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film .kasdan \\'s humor is of the best kind --soft spoken , and mostly dialogue - driven ( thoughthere are some great visual jokes ) .it \\'s the kind of humor that \\'s funny even after you \\'ve seen it five or six times .there \\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective .what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular .i ca n\\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero .as a side note , i do n\\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funnythat many do not , and vice versa .there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it .i have a feeling the humor here wo n\\'t appeal to everyone , but there \\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone \\'s interest .jake kasdan , son of writer / director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old .i found this out after seeing the film , and i ca n\\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker .his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed .zero effect is the kind of film that i \\'ll buy for my collection-- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul.at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , andi was satisfied with the outcome .and , with kasdan \\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .']\n",

      "[\"you 've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing .the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor 's nell in the haunting , we do n't care .the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike .the seasons have changed since an ex - patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom .desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ), malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) .the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm 's would - be killer :scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret .only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine - tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time .malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole 's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures .he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process .the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist .( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self - rearranging kitchen business from the latter . )it 's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks .cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they 're not out to harm him , really - they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler .perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we 're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight - year - old .that 's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar .we appreciate malcolm 's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed .both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest .willis convinces us that he 's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night .osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do .the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs ' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama - its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading .only because i was expecting something differentdid i notice - rather , feel - the movie 's running time , which is just shy of two hours .the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait .i 'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .\"\n",

      "[\"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it .probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it 's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it does n't feature slick one - liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80 's . however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made .corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life .one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him .her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion .maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another .they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover .lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it 's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend .this is not clear to lucas , however .he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what 's about to happen .we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally .they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie .surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school .the next scene is brilliant .maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally .she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened .he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion .in lesser movies this would 've turned into a confrontation between the two characters .but maggie is written smarter than that .she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him .next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) .he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend .what 's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks .of course anyone with a brain can tell what 's gon na happen next .cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas ' relationship .this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone .she 's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer / dryer so he can clean his shirt .maggie is charmed by cappie 's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body .this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires .desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room .it 's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) .lucas finally figures out what 's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance .this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team .the last third of the film revolves around this attempt .while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not .there are many surprisesduring the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up .dave grusin 's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps .lucas is filled with great performances .forget everything you know about corey haim .back in 1986he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain .kerri green is very appealingas maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her .sheen 's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas .there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti 's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks .also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar .when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and johnhughes that .lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so - called classics .but hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it 's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald .it deserves more than that , but i do n't want to be greedy .\"\n",
