      "['while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general .words \" croatia \" and \" croatians \" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations .the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth \\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context .in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers \\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise .same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime .the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe .his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro .shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away .after being arrested and tortured by kimba \\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) .upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\\'etat against kimba .shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war .thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary .it should n\\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books .those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman \\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre .this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires .unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work .the movie does n\\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda .christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role .his performance in this film perhaps is n\\'t breathtaking , yet adequate .his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \" normal \" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends .although the movie does n\\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken \\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character .however , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon \\'s reluctant colleague .this was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director .with the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess .luckily , the dogs of war had a good script .irvin \\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel .the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places .in the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes .unfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also did n\\'t help .but , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama .'\n",
      " 'with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft \\'s square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top - selling game franchise , is visually awe - inspiring and groundbreaking .no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved .but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ?obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi .everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail: individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects .overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they do n\\'t sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling .but you wo n\\'t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one ,the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering ,\" wow . . .\" like the series of games , final fantasy \\'s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi .it \\'s the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien \" phantoms .\" whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often - invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) .while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a \" zeus cannon , \" dr .akiross ( ming - na ) and dr .sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a \" wave \" using eight collected \" spirits \" to counteract the phantoms and kill them off .while the images serve the sci - fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling does n\\'t .it \\'s unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out.perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script .some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay .nevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes .why do these aliens feed on souls ?if they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ?what is so special about the \" spirits \" that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ?worse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science - heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who \\'s doing the talking .for the most part , it \\'s bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines do n\\'t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes .the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments .but , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you \\'re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked.there \\'s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film.you \\'d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more .'\n",
      " \"with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different .its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books .the parallels do n't end there , either .atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big - screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king 's dreamcatcher .even the film 's content is a bit reminiscent of mile .in fact , it 's the perfect blend of the feel - good ' 60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile .king 's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film 's title comes from the second chapter ) .it 's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year - old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin )lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self - centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould 's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son .bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich .when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby 's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror .ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers .i wo n't go into what these powers are , but they 're considerably toned down from the book ( and do n't involve black stuff flying out of ted 's mouth , a la mile ) .atlantis ' present - day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel 's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle - aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years .atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks ' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar - nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski 's red .the acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr .lecter .most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider .while i did n't really have much of a problem with goldman 's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency .goldman , for those of you who do n't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else 's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he 's penned ( like the general 's daughter ) .it 's mean - spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o .j . and robert blake ) .in atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back .well , he 's not , and it does n't make sense .1: 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements\"]\n",

      "['you \\'ve got to love disney .no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it \\'s animated .kids have to go see the movie .then they have to get the toys .oh , the video came out ?got to buy it , or risk little billy \\'s temper tantrums for the next month .all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom .stay at the disneyland hotel !buy a disney t - shirt !eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick !it \\'s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it .dale carnegie should have had it so good .what \\'s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality .you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot .the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not .the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same .however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box - office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer .luckily , disney \\'s latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula .the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan - yu ( miguel ferrer ) .soon , china \\'s emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china \\'s defense .when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou( soon - tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household .fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming - na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army .mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling .mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman \\'s role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points .very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one \\'s family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task .by leaving home to fight in her father \\'s place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too .as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film .i \\'m not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time .both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan \\'s army unit and obligatory love interest ,are more than competent , although salonga \\'s voice translates much better to animation .you have to hear it to understand .interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan .there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie .it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney \\'s own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing .artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale .there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan - yu \\'s hun army , which utilizes the same computer - enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast .the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it .when mulan resolves to take her father \\'s place , she dons her father \\'s old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword .as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal .it just left me thinking ,\" that was really cool . \" a wonderful range of performances delight the audiencethroughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon - tekoh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang \\'s conscripted army .even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan .although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance .i found the choice of b .d .wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short \\'s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything \\'s possible .in any event , wong performs admirably as well .one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa .she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people .june foray , who supplies grandmother fa \\'s speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) .marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa \\'s singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady .with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history .mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films .in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian - american actors for both lead and supporting roles .in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei .i guess clyde kusatsu was n\\'t available .at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults .this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better .'\n",
      " 'you \\'ve heard all the hype .you \\'ve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler \\'s list ) as qui - gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi - wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .if you \\'ve read any reviews , you \\'ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .you also may have heard that this one \\'s too kiddie - friendly , and does n\\'t have enough content for adults .believe the hype .the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic ,the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala \\'s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .but there \\'s something missing here , and it is n\\'t budget or effects- it \\'s everything money* ca n\\'t * buy .the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad - stroked and flat characters .the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui - gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi - wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence .he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .portman \\'s queen amidala and mcgregor \\'s obi - wan kenobi do n\\'t fare nearly so well .amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .and obi - wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he \\'s nothing but a robin to qui- gon jinn \\'s batman .however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity ,and he does a good job .he also absolutely nails alec guiness \\' ( obi - wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that \\'s one of the problems with this film .i would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i \\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .however , if you are the one person in america who * has n\\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who does n\\'t bother to brush - up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .for example , one of the film \\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .for those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader \\'s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back .\"so , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .a lot of the movie is like that .r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it \\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience \\'s pre - existing fondness for them . . . because he does n\\'t do much to add to it in any way .same goes for jabba the hutt , who does n\\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) ,coruscant (the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia \\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .what \\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .there \\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be .another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters .and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you \\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles .\" furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .oddly , this is n\\'t just*my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .well , he \\'s done a good job .the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight - year - old boy .that \\'s not jake lloyd \\'s fault , though -he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him .that \\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin \\'s future evil in the film .the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there \\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .but the only indication the audience gets that this kid is n\\'t allhearts and roses is yoda \\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui - gon jinn .his explanation ?\" his future is clouded .\"( warning : major spoiler ahead .enter at your own risk . )of course , the noble qui - gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary - looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double - sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .because qui - gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi - wan , qui - gon \\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi - wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker .did this story need to be told ?i would say no .but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely .if you do n\\'t enter the theater with jedi - size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , thenthis is your movie .the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . and yoda and young obi - wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time .above all , this is a fun movie .not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .but fun .maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co - write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : )'\n",

      "[\"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal .the setting of the film is a town named blue bay .it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town 's different benefactors .the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town 's ritzy , expensive high school .it is here that we meet all of the core characters .there 's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan .we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly .throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape .shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well .this pushes kelly 's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted .during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her .however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor .after sam is cleared , kelly 's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her .it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together .it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda .matt dillon stars as sam lombardo .sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage .he is n't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance .however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place .neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller .suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film .campbell is very successful with this character ,adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra .one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well .kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film .however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .still , the film does n't seem to gain much from bacon 's performance , only his name .in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin - vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam 's lawyer , ken bowden . hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters .this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it 's share of twists .\"\n",
      " 'with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late \\' 90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically .for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer \\'s incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards .lola , a contemporary goth - girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day .it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he does n\\'t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed .this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies .so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she \\'ll be able to obtain the money and save a life .> from there, as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like \" sliding doors on steroids .with a non - stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something .indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious .very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film .the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer \\'s movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) .thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash .while you are watching , this will not matter .running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wishedwas longer because it was so damn good while it lasted.it is the equivalent of a roller - coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . ?1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;'\n",
      " 'zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we do n\\'t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film .zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he \\'d like to think so ) .however , he \\'s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are .zero \\'s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a \" normal \" guy who does the business side of the job -- he \\'s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero \\'s greatness as an investigator .the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero \\'s talents to soon - to - be client gregory stark ( ryan o\\'neal ) .it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about .zero takes the case , and the plot thickens .his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) .despite her luminous and seemingly - harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark .through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him .i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film .i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown \\'s greatness ) .zero effect , which is jake kasdan \\'s first effort as writer / director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts :it \\'san original , funny , and completely involving motion picture .with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them .but he did n\\'t just successfully avoid flaws: he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment .take , for starters ,the great cast of characters .pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really have n\\'t seen from him since spaceballs .zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he \\'s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe .pullman \\'s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice - over as he \\'s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious.ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he \\'s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny .\"i \\'ll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point .\"i have a gun , and everything .\" his character is also well - drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job .o\\'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs .i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film .kasdan \\'s humor is of the best kind --soft spoken , and mostly dialogue - driven ( thoughthere are some great visual jokes ) .it \\'s the kind of humor that \\'s funny even after you \\'ve seen it five or six times .there \\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective .what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular .i ca n\\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero .as a side note , i do n\\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funnythat many do not , and vice versa .there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it .i have a feeling the humor here wo n\\'t appeal to everyone , but there \\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone \\'s interest .jake kasdan , son of writer / director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old .i found this out after seeing the film , and i ca n\\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker .his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed .zero effect is the kind of film that i \\'ll buy for my collection-- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul.at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , andi was satisfied with the outcome .and , with kasdan \\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .']\n",

      "['whenever writer / director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms .he made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs .miller \" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard - boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \" popeye \" ( 1980 ) .the same holds true for his most recent film , \" the gingerbread man , \" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie .by the time \" the gingerbread man \" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham .there \\'s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o\\'donnell or matt damon , and it does n\\'t feature a great showdown in a courtroom .instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \" the gingerbread man \" is a rain - soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman \\'s trademark full - frontal female nudity .the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham \\'s other lawyer heroes .he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry - red $ 80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds .rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) .a reason is never given for the divorce , but it is n\\'t hard to surmise that rick \\'s womanizing had a large part in it .whenever he \\'s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it \\'s because he \\'s been \" screwing around .\"after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he has n\\'t lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses .he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together .rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare - footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers .it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \" weird \" stuff like that .as another character puts it , dixon is \" a few beers short of six - pack .\" rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency .he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory \\'s begrudging ex - husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) .dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out .from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double - crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action .altman \\'s cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look .if it is n\\'t night - time , at least it \\'s raining .gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light .a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability .in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world .altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies .but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings .\"the gingerbread man \" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here .however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action / thriller .a great deal of the credit for the film \\'s success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction .here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic .rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick \\'s pain and frustration .the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart - breaking role as the jewish maid in \" schindler \\'s list \" ( 1993 ) .tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on - screen time just looking weird .it does n\\'t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film \\'s one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing .while \" the gingerbread man \" is n\\'t in league with altman \\'s greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career .some critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and do n\\'t make money .altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .'\n",

      " 'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller \\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off - the - wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter - brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) .their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime - gone - wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film .the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but did n\\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who \\'s wise to the world , but he does n\\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax .that main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film \\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county .\"the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline - psychotic who \\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody \\'s cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? !\"he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who \\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) .these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it \\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter .if that does n\\'t give you a good idea of this film \\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude \\'s rug .they \\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) andwhose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) .the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he does n\\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $ 1 million ransom .unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop - off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude \\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money .soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn .meanwhile , the big lebowski \\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant - garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family .the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc .the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival \\'s \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) .the film does n\\'t feature quite as many one - liners and sight gags as the coens \\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude \\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact .the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations -but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution .there \\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy - handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech .the coens take aim at just about every elite l .a .subculture in the book :the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on .by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters .he also turns out to have a pretty well - functioning brain in his head , even if he does n\\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he \\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end .the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they do n\\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either .i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowskia standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter - brained .audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un - dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first .\"it \\'s good knowin \\' he \\'s out there , the dude , takin \\' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end .i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken .']\n",

      " \"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) directed by robert altman some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel .the novel was a summer smash , topping best - seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads .the only problem : the novel was n't very good .it was far more pulp than pulitzer .but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller .so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen .the director ?francis ford coppola .the book , of course , was mario puzo 's the godfather .the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history .by bringing up the godfather , i do n't mean to suggest that robert altman 's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness .but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material .can you get any more questionable than john grisham ?depends on whom you ask .but there 's no question that grisham 's work grabs people .like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who ca n't tell a well - constructed story from a can of spam .so something in grisham 's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america 's greatest living filmmakers .the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon .> from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe .this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch .witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear .we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone .right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises .pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman .this is what a great director can do for questionable source material .the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases .magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office .outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen .driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home .there he learns more about mallory 's life than he bargained for .her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski - style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter .magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory 's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed- right after he sleeps with her , of course .this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end .he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well .but then dixon 's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger .the cops wo n't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney .his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private - eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) .if this predicament was n't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos .altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh 's performance holds the gingerbread man together .an accomplished actor when he is n't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives .is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ?magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it 's too late .as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are .and life is never so bad that it ca n't get worse . if you 're familiar with altman 's work , you 'll recognize several of his signature techniques .characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent .crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action .dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style .and of course there 'smy favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot .thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i 've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand .and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether .the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film .is it old - school sexism , or a clever in - joke ?you be the judge .but back to the picture at hand .in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we 've all endured .in the hands of a masterlike altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese 's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result .what may prevent it from enduring with altman 's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham 's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up .but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through .that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are .they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill .and that , my friends , should make you very afraid .\"\n",

      "['with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late \\' 90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically .for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer \\'s incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards .lola , a contemporary goth - girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day .it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he does n\\'t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed .this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies .so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she \\'ll be able to obtain the money and save a life .> from there, as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like \" sliding doors on steroids .with a non - stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something .indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious .very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film .the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer \\'s movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) .thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash .while you are watching , this will not matter .running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wishedwas longer because it was so damn good while it lasted.it is the equivalent of a roller - coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . ?1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;'\n",
      " \"you 've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over ` keeping the faith ' .it 's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head - on .as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio .while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away .now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs .the likable and kind - hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi .on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as ` the god squad ' .in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory .everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums .now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again .with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there 's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters .predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but ` keeping the faith ' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point ato point b .edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller ` primal fear ' . after shockingly bitter roles in ` american history x ' and , most recently , david fincher 's vicious ` fight club ' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice .not in the least .norton slips into the director 's chair for the first time with ` keeping the faith ' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg .weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut.in addition , norton pushes all the right buttonswith the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence .stiller ( the zipper guy from ` there 's something about mary ' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully - ripened comic maturity .elfman 's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv 's ` dharma and greg ' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here .the remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob 's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice .` keeping the faith ' is the perfect date flick...though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general .there is turbulence during the process of lift - off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead .once the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful.stiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities .we enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true .this is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements .nonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly wo n't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else 's in the audience .` keeping the faith ' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion .aww , what the hell .the quality is not quite heaven - sent , but this little charmer could revive our ` faith ' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre .\"\n",

? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .and obi - wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he \\'s nothing but a robin to qui- gon jinn \\'s batman .however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity ,and he does a good job .he also absolutely nails alec guiness \\' ( obi - wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that \\'s one of the problems with this film .i would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i \\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .however , if you are the one person in america who * has n\\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who does n\\'t bother to brush - up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .for example , one of the film \\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .for those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader \\'s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back .\"so , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .a lot of the movie is like that .r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it \\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience \\'s pre - existing fondness for them . . . because he does n\\'t do much to add to it in any way .same goes for jabba the hutt , who does n\\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) ,coruscant (the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia \\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .what \\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .there \\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be .another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters .and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you \\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles .\" furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .oddly , this is n\\'t just*my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .well , he \\'s done a good job .the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight - year - old boy .that \\'s not jake lloyd \\'s fault , though -he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him .that \\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin \\'s future evil in the film .the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there \\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .but the only indication the audience gets that this kid is n\\'t allhearts and roses is yoda \\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui - gon jinn .his explanation ?\" his future is clouded .\"( warning : major spoiler ahead .enter at your own risk . )of course , the noble qui - gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary - looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double - sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .because qui - gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi - wan , qui - gon \\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi - wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker .did this story need to be told ?i would say no .but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely .if you do n\\'t enter the theater with jedi - size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , thenthis is your movie .the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . and yoda and young obi - wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time .above all , this is a fun movie .not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .but fun .maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co - write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : )']\n",

      "['with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like \" rock and roll !\"( actually , it \\'s \" lock and load \" ) , you ca n\\'t help thinking tarantino .and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers .but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon .\" inspired by true events \" -- we \\'ve heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . .or so strangely poignant .for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged .beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker .they fall in love and marry , but pam \\'s increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris .when chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up .then , chris begins to rob banks . . .luke perry accomplishes the not - inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer .moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long - suffering husband .( it \\'s another of john mcnaughton \\'s coups of casting - against - type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) .but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person .if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it \\'s in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia .as in those movies , there \\'s the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece .judd does n\\'t entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam \\'s \\' craziness \\' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more \\' normal \\' chris .when pam reacts to her father - in - law \\'s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris \\' face is the picture of pained restraint .of course , it \\'s the question of what is \\' normal \\' that is asked in normal life .mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity .it is the rational chris that loves guns ( \" shooting is about precision , control \" ) and the \\' crazy \\' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- \" chaos and you and me . . .we \\'re a real family \" , she notes wryly ) .it is chris \\' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well - planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) .in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : \" buy - more \" -- the perfectly respectable consumption - crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations .it \\'s not a perfect film .some of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) .the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam \\'s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film .indeed , as in mcnaughton \\'s seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre, that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths .mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly \\' realistic \\' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer .the suburbs , with their miles of white - fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness .in its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick \\'s badlands .while pam shares the yearnings of malick \\'s heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a \\' normal life \\' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies .but these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the \\' normal \\' , conventional world .pam \\'s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement .the flying inkpot \\'s rating system :* wait for the video .** a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !** * pretty good , bring a friend .*** * amazing , potent stuff .**** * perfection . see it twice .'\n",
